    <p>Looking for a moist banana bread recipe that never fails? Your friends and family will ask for this never-dry banana bread again and again. 
        The secret to this melt-in-your-mouth banana bread? Sour cream. The eggs and butter (and the bananas themselves) lend moisture, but the rich and tangy sour cream takes the texture over the top. </p>
